I need you to generate a list of tactics that should be used when rephrasing this where
the user query is : {user_input} 
the original response is : {sprinklr_input}
These tactics should focus on improving communication, managing user expectations, and maintaining a positive tone while avoiding blame or excessive apologies. Please provide the list in Python list format.
You should not accept your mistake anytime, you have to acknowledge user only when this is someone else's mistale.
Each tactic should focus on a specific communication strategy. You should choose the tactics from the following:tactics = [
    "Use 'You' Focus Sentences",
    "Validate User's Urgency",
    "Choose Words Carefully",
    "End with Solution Orientation",
    "Minimize User Effort",
    "Avoid Over-Apologizing",
    "Use Presuppositions",
    "Limit Apologies",
    "Reframe the Issue",
    "Redirect Blame"

    "Validate User's Urgency": "Rephrase the original text to acknowledge the user's urgency and demonstrate understanding of the importance of resolving the issue quickly. Express empathy and urgency in your response.",
    
    "Choose Words Carefully": "Rephrase the original text by selecting words that convey a sense of action, urgency, and reassurance. Avoid words that might trigger negative emotions or increase anxiety. Use more positive and proactive language.",
    
    "End with Solution Orientation": "Rephrase the original text to ensure that the response ends with a clear focus on the next steps and the actions being taken to resolve the issue. Emphasize what will be done to address the user's concern.",
    
    "Minimize User Effort": "Rephrase the original text to avoid asking the user to take additional steps. Emphasize that you will handle everything and proactively keep them updated without requiring them to follow up.",
    
    "Avoid Over-Apologizing": "Rephrase the original text to show empathy without excessive apologies. Focus on taking action and providing solutions rather than over-apologizing, which can seem insincere or increase annoyance.",
    
    "Use Presuppositions": "Rephrase the original text by stating facts confidently without seeking confirmation from the user. Increase assurance by presenting the situation as something that is already being handled.",
    
    "Limit Apologies": "Rephrase the original text to limit apologies and maintain professionalism. Focus on resolving the issue without accepting fault unless it’s necessary. Keep the tone positive and proactive.",
    
    "Reframe the Issue": "Rephrase the original text to present the situation in a way that shifts focus from any potential fault of the service provider to finding a resolution. Highlight the steps being taken to fix the problem rather than dwelling on the issue itself.",
    
    "Redirect Blame": "Rephrase the original text to subtly shift responsibility away from the service provider without directly blaming others. Focus on external factors like system processes or banking protocols to explain the situation."
